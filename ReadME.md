A webpage based off the images and description provided by Red Academy. It is a simple webpage on a store's featured products page.

## Technologies Used

## Personal Learnings
These two weeks spent working on this project have taught me more than I did learning from home alone for 2 months. Using the correct syntax and connecting different files has become much easier for me. Learning GitHub has also been a great experience as I am now much more confident in using version control systems. 
 
### Installation Instructions
Have all of the files available on your computer so that everything may run properly. You will need the 
following files: index.html, style.css, reset.css, app.js, and the Flickity CSS and Javascript files which are for the Flickity plugin.
