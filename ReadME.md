# Aloha Webpage 


 #Technologies Used
 HTML, CSS, Javascript.
 



 #Personal Learnings
These two weeks working on this project have taught me more than 2 months learning from home alone. Learning the correct syntax and connecting different files has
become much easier for me. Learning GitHub has also been
a great experience as I am now much more confident in using version control systems. 


 
 #Installation Instructions
 Have all of the files available on your computer so that everything may run properly. You will need the 
 following files: index.html, style.css, reset.css, app.js, and the Flickity CSS and Javascript files which are for the Flickity plugin.
